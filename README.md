# Olympics-Data-Analysis


## Important notes
```
There are 2 csv files "athlete_events" and "athlete_event2.csv". In excel Extract all data from  "athlete_event2.csv" and append it in "athlete_events" and save as "athlete_events".
We are doing this because at the time of uploading csv file we noticed that our csv size was too large .
All data is compatible according to "athlete_events" to name not "athlete_event2.csv"
```
